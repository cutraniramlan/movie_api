        <p>To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
            application will provide users with access to information about different
            movies, directors and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
            personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>

        <h2>Feature</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Return a list of ALL movies to the user;</li>
            <li>eturn data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it is featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user;</li>
            <li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”);</li>
            <li>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name;</li>
            <li>Allow new users to register;</li>
            <li>Allow users to update their user info (username);</li>
            <li>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites (showing only a text that a movie has been added—more on this later);</li>
            <li>Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites (showing only a text that a movie has been removed—more on this later);</li>
